    In the future, always keep a TODO or README note in the folder to indicate
    what is modified to the modules, for what purposes.

    Here the modules_ipstone is modified to run mouse WGS samples:
        - there are also some tweaks for indel call comparision (changes to
          allow only 1 indel call to be kept in the final somatic indel
          result)
